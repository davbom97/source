# Curiosity as a driver
Since i started my engineering university i developed a sense of curiosity for the unknown, finding the solution to a problem
has always intrigued me and pushed me to research and improve methods and knowledge.

On this site i publish some problems i tried to solve, trying to find the best solutions, and the constant improvement of those.

Besides, i enjoy the company and connection with people which brought me to become passionate about languages and learn english, german,
and spanish;
